This is an android application designed to automatically switch off the flashlight after a set amount of time
I keep my phone NOT on my night stand otherwise i can easily reach my phone and snooze. My light switch is a little far from bed so i cant see anything when i switch it off.
So i decided to over-engineer a lighting system which works with a remote along with an automated tempreture regulator to keep the lights cool. 
And yes, its RGB too because as we all know RGB gives extra FPS when playing games.  

My original plan was to make an android application so that i wouln't have to make a separate lighting system just for that single task. 
This app is a simple app which uses a timer to switch off the flashlight. So when i go to bed for instance i can set a 60 second timer. 
So i can get in my bed comfy comfy and after 60 seconds the light will turn off. is this an unnecessary app for a basic thing? yes but will that stop me from making an app?
hell nahh. 

And yes i know google assistant is a thing but i prefer not to scream at night telling google to turn off my light and accidentally call 911. 

This is my second application which is made for my personal needs. First application is not on my github. 

Made using Android Studio. Java.
